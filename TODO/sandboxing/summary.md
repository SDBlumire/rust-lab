# Summary

We'll need a way to make sure that letting a user access all the features of a systems level
language can be made safe and secure. Some form of virtualisation, a container maybe? I'm completely
open to suggestions, I know how I'd implement it based on how things run at my work, but I'd be open
to suggestions. Maybe even writing our own sandboxing virtualisation to try and keep everything in
rust, but this isn't a requirement.
