# rust-lab
Rust, in the Cloud.

## General Priorities

Do as much of it as we can in rust.

## TODO List

PR in all suggestions and expansions. Each suggestion should be a markdown file in `TODO/<task>/`
where task one of the topics listed below. General details for each can be found in summary.md
inside TODO folder. Format each suggestion in the format in `TODO/template.md`, cap each line of
text at 100 characters.

* `sandboxing`
* `workflow`
* `ui` 
* `api` 

If I've missed something critical in this TODO list, PR it in too. Hell, PR anything and everything.
